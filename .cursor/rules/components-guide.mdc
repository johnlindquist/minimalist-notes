# Components

Reusable UI components are located in the `components/` directory.

-   General components are directly within `components/`.
-   More specific UI primitives or components from a UI library (like shadcn/ui) are likely in `components/ui/`.
-   [`components.json`](mdc:components.json) might be related to the management or configuration of these UI components, possibly for a library like shadcn/ui.
