# Task: Documentation - Update OpenAPI for Delete Note Endpoint

**Parallel Task Group**: 2024-07-26-10-00
**Task Number**: 3 of 3
**Estimated Duration**: 1.5 hours
**Dependencies**: None (parallel task)

## Objective
Update the OpenAPI specification (`docs/openapi/notes-api.yaml`) to include the newly added `DELETE /api/notes` endpoint. Ensure all parameters, request bodies (if any), and responses are accurately documented.

## File Scope
**Files to Modify**:
- `docs/openapi/notes-api.yaml`

**Files to Create**:
- None

## Verification
- [ ] No conflicts with other parallel tasks (verified by lead/coordinator).
- [ ] OpenAPI specification is valid after changes.
- [ ] The `DELETE /api/notes` endpoint is documented correctly, including:
    - Path and method.
    - Summary and description.
    - Parameters (e.g., `id` as a query parameter).
    - Expected responses (e.g., 204 No Content, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found).
- [ ] Can be merged independently.

## Commits

### Commit 1: docs: Add DELETE /api/notes endpoint to OpenAPI spec
**Files**:
- `docs/openapi/notes-api.yaml`
**Changes**:
- Add a new path item for `/api/notes` with a `delete` operation.
- Define parameters (e.g., `id` in query).
- Define success responses (e.g., `204`).
- Define error responses (e.g., `400`, `404`).

**Verification**:
- [ ] OpenAPI file validates successfully (e.g., using Swagger Editor or a CLI validator).
- [ ] No lint errors (if a linter is used for OpenAPI).
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects the implemented DELETE endpoint.

## Post-Task
- [ ] Regenerate any client libraries or documentation UIs if they are based on the OpenAPI spec.
