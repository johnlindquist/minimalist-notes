# Task: Backend - Implement Delete Note API Endpoint

**Parallel Task Group**: 2024-07-26-10-00
**Task Number**: 2 of 3
**Estimated Duration**: 2 hours
**Dependencies**: None (parallel task)

## Objective
Create a backend API endpoint (`DELETE /api/notes`) to handle the deletion of a specific note by its ID. The ID will be passed in the request body or as a query parameter.

## File Scope
**Files to Modify**:
- `app/api/notes/route.ts`

**Files to Create**:
- None

## Verification
- [ ] No conflicts with other parallel tasks (verified by lead/coordinator).
- [ ] API endpoint `DELETE /api/notes?id=<noteId>` successfully deletes the specified note.
- [ ] Returns appropriate status codes (e.g., 200/204 on success, 400 for bad request/missing ID, 404 if note not found).
- [ ] Proper error handling is implemented.
- [ ] Independent test suite passes (e.g., new tests for `app/api/notes/route.test.ts`).
- [ ] Can be merged independently.

## Commits

### Commit 1: feat: Implement DELETE handler for /api/notes
**Files**:
- `app/api/notes/route.ts`
**Changes**:
- Add a `DELETE` async function to handle requests.
- Extract `noteId` from the request (e.g., query parameters or JSON body).
- Implement logic to find and delete the note from the data store.
- Return appropriate JSON responses and status codes.

**Verification**:
- [ ] Unit tests for the DELETE handler pass.
- [ ] Manual testing with tools like Postman or curl confirms functionality.
- [ ] No lint errors.
- [ ] Feature works in isolation.

## Post-Task
- [ ] Update `app/api/notes/route.test.ts` with new test cases for the delete functionality.
- [ ] Update API documentation (handled by Parallel Task 3).
