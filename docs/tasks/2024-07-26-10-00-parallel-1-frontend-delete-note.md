# Task: Frontend - Implement Note Deletion UI

**Parallel Task Group**: 2024-07-26-10-00
**Task Number**: 1 of 3
**Estimated Duration**: 3 hours
**Dependencies**: None (parallel task)

## Objective
Implement the UI functionality to allow users to delete notes. This includes adding a delete button to each note and handling the API call to the backend for deletion. A confirmation step should be included.

## File Scope
**Files to Modify**:
- `app/page.tsx`

**Files to Create**:
- `components/delete-confirmation-dialog.tsx`

## Verification
- [ ] No conflicts with other parallel tasks (verified by lead/coordinator)
- [ ] Delete button appears for each note.
- [ ] Clicking delete button shows a confirmation dialog.
- [ ] Confirming deletion calls the `DELETE /api/notes` endpoint with the correct note ID.
- [ ] Note is removed from the UI upon successful deletion.
- [ ] Cancelling deletion closes the dialog and does nothing.
- [ ] Independent test suite passes (if applicable for UI components).
- [ ] Can be merged independently.
